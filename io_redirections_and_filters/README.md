A collection of shell scripts exploring input/output redirection and text processing in Linux. These scripts demonstrate various ways to manipulate files, handle text streams, and use filter commands.

### Basic File Operations
- Want to say hello? Run `0-hello_world`

### File Management
- Create special filenames using `7-file`
- Save directory listings with `8-cwd_state`
- Duplicate content using `9-duplicate_last_line`
- Clean up those pesky .js files with `10-no_more_js`
- Count directories with `11-directories`
- Find recent files using `12-newest_files`

### Text Processing Magic
- Find unique words with `13-unique`
- Search for patterns using `14-findthatword` and `15-countthatword`
- Look around patterns with `16-whatsnext`
- Filter out content with `17-hidethisword`
- Work with letters using `18-letteronly`
- Replace characters with `19-AZ`
- Remove specific letters using `20-hiago`
