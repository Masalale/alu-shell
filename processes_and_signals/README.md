# Processes and Signals

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains bash scripts created while learning about processes and signals in Linux.

## What's Inside?

Here's a breakdown of each script and what it does:

* `0-what-is-my-pid` - Displays its own PID
* `1-list_your_processes` - Lists all currently running processes
* `2-show_your_bash_pid` - Shows processes containing the word "bash"
* `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy` - Displays the PID of processes containing the word "bash"
* `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` - Creates an infinite loop that displays text
* `5-dont_stop_me_now` - Stops the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process
* `6-stop_me_if_you_can` - Stops the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process without kill
* `7-highlander` - Creates an infinite loop with signal handling
* `8-beheaded_process` - Kills the process 7-highlander
* `10-process_and_pid_file` - Creates a file with PID and handles various signals
* `11-manage_my_process` - Manages a background process with start/stop/restart
* `manage_my_process` - The process being managed by 11-manage_my_process

Each script demonstrates different aspects of process management and signal handling in Linux.
