# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my collection of bash scripts that I created while learning about shell, I/O Redirections and filters.

## What's Inside?

Here's a breakdown of each script and what it does:

* `0-current_working_directory` - Prints the absolute path name of the current working directory

* `5-listfilesdigitonly` - Displays current directory contents with user and group IDs
* `6-firstdirectory` - Creates a directory named `my_first_directory` in the `/tmp/` directory
* `7-movethatfile` - Moves the file `betty` from `/tmp/` to `/tmp/my_first_directory`
* `8-firstdelete` - Deletes the file `betty`
* `9-firstdirdeletion` - Deletes the directory `my_first_directory` that is in the `/tmp` directory
* `10-back` - Changes the working directory to the previous one
* `11-lists` - Lists all files in current directory and parent directory and the `/boot` directory
