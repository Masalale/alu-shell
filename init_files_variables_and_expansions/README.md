# Init Files, Variables and Expansions

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my collection of bash scripts that I created while learning about shell initialization files, variables, and expansions.

## What's Inside?

Here's a breakdown of each script and what it does:

* `0-alias` - A handy script that creates an alias
* `1-hello_you` - Gives you a friendly `hello user` greeting
* `2-path` - Adds /action to your PATH (because who doesn't need more actions?)
* `3-paths` - Helps you count how many directories are in your PATH
* `4-global_variables` - Shows you all those environment variables hanging around
* `5-local_variables` - Displays local variables, environment variables, and functions
* `6-create_local_variable` - Creates a new local variable (keeping it in the family)
* `7-create_global_variable` - Creates a global variable (sharing is caring!)
* `8-true_knowledge` - Does some simple addition with a stored number
* `9-divide_and_rule` - Handles division operations
* `10-love_exponent_breath` - Raises numbers to powers (math magic!)
* `11-binary_to_decimal` - Converts binary to decimal (for when you're feeling binary)
* `12-combinations` - Generates all possible letter combinations
* `13-print_float` - Formats numbers with two decimal places (precision is key!)
